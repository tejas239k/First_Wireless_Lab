# First_Wireless_Lab
Here we have created a wireless network for home. Here some devices are connected with wire and some wirelessly and both are configured dynamically using dhcp, with ip addresses assigned by R1. We can ping a wired device from a wireless device and vice versa as they are in the same network.
